/**
 * The Learn playground — one scene, configured per topic, on iOS and Android.
 *
 * The scene carries the geometry; this file is the instrument panel around it.
 * Which layers open, what the play button moves and where the camera starts all
 * come from `lib/learn/playground-config`, so a topic about the day opens
 * spinning the planet with its three day-arcs showing, and one about sankranti
 * opens creeping along the राशि belt with the Sun's sightline lit.
 *
 * Nothing is taken away by that. The group chips — बर्ष · सूर्य · दिन · अक्ष
 * झुकाव — plus the belt chips reach every layer in the scene from any topic, so
 * a reader who wants the whole picture is one press from it. The config decides
 * the opening frame, not the ceiling.
 *
 * The clock and camera live in refs and are mutated by the render loop, so
 * neither playing nor dragging re-renders React. What React sees is a sample
 * the scene hands back a few times a second, and the readouts are drawn from
 * that and nothing else.
 *
 * ── what this file does differently from the web's `DayPlaygroundStudy` ──
 *
 *   - **Touch, not pointers.** A `PanResponder` on the canvas wrapper, the same
 *     one the other 3D diagrams use: one finger orbits, two pinch the camera
 *     distance. There is no wheel to zoom with, so the pinch has to carry it.
 *   - **Panels are sheets, not popovers.** A 290px drawer floating over a phone
 *     canvas covers the thing it is adjusting. The controls and the focus menu
 *     open as bottom sheets over the whole card instead, which is the pattern
 *     the rest of this app already uses for its own pickers.
 *   - **Fullscreen is a `Modal`.** No portal and no Fullscreen API on a phone —
 *     and a modal is better here anyway, since it takes the status bar and the
 *     tab bar with it.
 *   - **`<select>` becomes chips.** The planet presets are a scrolling row, and
 *     the focus radio group a segmented row, because neither has a native
 *     dropdown worth reaching for at this size.
