"""
Bikram Sambat Calendar Constants
================================

This module contains the lookup tables and constants needed for
Bikram Sambat <-> Gregorian calendar conversion.

The Bikram Sambat calendar is Nepal's official calendar. It is a solar
calendar but with month lengths that vary by year in a non-formulaic way.
Therefore, we use a lookup table approach for accurate conversion.

Coverage: 2000-2099 BS official lookup; 1700-1999 and 2100-2200 sankranti estimated.

Important: static lookup coverage is not the same as structured official
provenance. See app.calendar.provenance for the source-backed ranges.
